/**
 * Create a rate limiter with read-only middleware + explicit record/reset hooks.
 *
 * The middleware only checks the limit; route handlers decide which outcomes
 * count by calling `recordFailure(ip, account)` on real failures or
 * `reset(ip, account)` on success. Mirrors the `auth-rate-limit.ts` shape used
 * by IMAP/SMTP so that successful logins don't pin the counter and transient
 * 500s don't burn the per-IP quota.
 *
 * When `options.identityOf` is given (as for the login limiter), failures are
 * tracked at two granularities: a per-IP aggregate bucket that every failure
 * from the IP feeds, plus one bucket per attempted identity under that IP.
 * The middleware refuses when either trips, and a success clears only the
 * authenticating account's own bucket — the aggregate keeps accumulating, so
 * one account's success can no longer forgive another account's failures from
 * the same IP (#1032).
 *
 * Each call to createLimiter gets its own isolated attempt Maps so that
 * separate limiters (e.g. loginLimiter and tokenLimiter) do not share
 * counters.
 *
 * @param maxAttempts Maximum attempts allowed within the window
 * @param message Error message to return when limit is exceeded
 * @param options.identityOf Extracts the attempted identity from a request so
 *   the middleware can check that account's bucket in addition to the IP's
